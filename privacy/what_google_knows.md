# What Google *Really* Knows About You

Everyone knows Google tracks you, just like Microsoft and Facebook. Not everyone knows to what extent.
And certainly not everyone knows what happens with that data.

## Interesting Question
Google started out as a search engine company. When you search on Google, they store that info *forever*.
After a while, they *partially* anonymize it. This means, there are still some things that can actually link to you, and they have (eventually) admitted that.

Despite Google's privacy policy, they actually do sell your data; just not directly. When you see an ad run by Google, your personal information is given to thousands of companies.
Your information determines how high the company will pay to place an ad in front of you; you see the highest bidder's ad.

This means things like Grammarly that you see ads about are getting your personal information, without your consent.

## Watch your Mouth

Google can *hear* you as well, too. Google Home is listening for "hey Google" or "ok Google" before sending everything after that to Google.
The part the listens until you say "hey Google" is on the device. However, because it only needs to really detect 2-3 words, it can hear you wrong.

This means you might be talking about how DuckDuckGo is better than Google, and your Google Home thinks you said "hey Google".
Then your friend might change the topic, and Google gets all of it.

They also never delete your voice activity. Besides keep the dictation transcripts (what the AI thought you said), they also store a recording.

That means they know what your voice sounds like, and can hear background noises.

Google's contractors secretly listen to recordings from Google Assistant.

Besides that, there's also Google Voice Search. It uses `WebkitSpeechRecognition`, an API in Safari and Chromium-based browsers that sends microphone data to a server
and gets the transcript as a response.

Regular Chrome sends it to Google, Safari sends it to Apple, and Microsoft Edge sends it to, well, Microsoft.

However, you can't get transcripts until *AFTER* the person is done talking, so Google sends a live stream of your voice to *their* server while you're talking.

This means they can store *those* recordings, too.

Besides that, Nest thermostats have been rumored in the past to contain microphones hidden by Google for the sole purpose of recording you.

And because Google owns Android, they can listen in on you through your phone.

Ever entered your credit card number into a Google product?

Maybe you put it in Chrome to autofill it for you, or you used it to purchase a book from Google Play.

Wherever you put it in, Google now has your credit card number. The scary thing is, most stores don't require *ANY* verification it's really you (online *AND* physically).

In fact, lots of stores are removing the need to sign your signature.

Easily put, Google can now use YOUR money, and this is dangerous. Especially since they sell your data off to every company.
